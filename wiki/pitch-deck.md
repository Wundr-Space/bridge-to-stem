# Gen-Connect: Startup Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1: Title

# **Gen-Connect**

### Connecting Relatable STEM Mentors with the Next Generation

**Tagline:** We activate diverse employees at major tech companies as relatable mentors for students from similar backgrounds, handling all operational complexity to deliver measurable social mobility impact.

---

## Slide 2: Context / Problem

### The Generation Gap in STEM

**The Statistics Tell a Stark Story:**
- **9%** - Low socioeconomic background representation in UK tech
- **26%** - Women in STEM workforce (fewer than 1 in 4)
- **65%** - White men dominate STEM roles

### Who's the Customer?

**Primary:** Major STEM/Tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG)
- Social Mobility Index Top 75 employers
- Public D&I commitments and ESG reporting requirements
- 1,000+ UK employees with diverse workforce

**Secondary:** Public secondary schools
- 30%+ free school meals (FSM) eligibility
- "Requires Improvement" OFSTED ratings
- 900-1,500 students, overstretched careers provision (0.5 FTE)

### Current Pain Points

**For Corporates:**
- ❌ Cannot demonstrate **authentic social mobility impact** beyond donations
- ❌ Employee volunteering is **ad-hoc, uncoordinated, unmeasured**
- ❌ Work placements **blocked by safeguarding/insurance barriers**
  - Example: Microsoft only allows placements for employees' children
- ❌ Generic schools outreach **doesn't activate diverse employees**
- ❌ No way to track: "Did our CSR investment change student outcomes?"

**For Schools:**
- ❌ **No capacity** to coordinate employer engagement (0.5 FTE for 1,500 students)
- ❌ Students get **low-quality work placements** (local shops, hairdressers)
- ❌ **No alumni network** or relatable role models
- ❌ **OFSTED criticism** of weak community engagement

**For Students:**
- ❌ Never met anyone in STEM from similar background
- ❌ Perception: **"Tech is for posh kids, not people like me"**
- ❌ Social isolation being "only one" (only girl, only Black student, only working-class)
- ❌ Career-closing decisions made **without information** at ages 14-16

### How They Currently Try to Solve It

**Corporates:**
- Generic STEM ambassadors (no relatability focus)
- Donations to Code First Girls, Stemettes (arm's-length, no employee engagement)
- Employee volunteering platforms like Benevity (disconnected from schools strategy)
- Graduate apprenticeships (age 18 - too late for perception change)

**Schools:**
- One-off career talks through personal contacts
- Parents' careers day (limited professional networks)
- Generic STEM outreach (no "someone like me" factor)

**Result:** None of these create the relatable connections that actually change student outcomes.

### Why This Problem is Urgent Now

**Critical Decision Point:** Students make career-shaping GCSE choices at ages 14-16
- Without exposure to relatable STEM role models, talented students close doors permanently
- Once GCSE subjects are chosen, redirecting to STEM pathways becomes extremely difficult

**ESG Pressure:** Companies face increasing stakeholder pressure for measurable D&I outcomes
- Social Mobility Index rankings drive competitive pressure
- Investors demand quantifiable social impact, not just donations

**Untapped Resource:** Companies have diverse employees who want to give back
- First-generation professionals remember struggling with lack of guidance
- ERG members measured on "impact hours" but lack structured pathways
- Companies can't activate this hidden asset

### Emotional & Economic Impact of Inaction

**For Students:**
- Talented students from working-class backgrounds miss STEM opportunities entirely
- Perception barriers ("not for people like me") perpetuate inequality
- Economic: Lifetime earnings gap between STEM and non-STEM careers

**For Corporates:**
- Reputational risk: D&I commitments seen as "just optics"
- Missed talent pipeline: homogeneous recruitment continues
- Economic: Wasted CSR budgets with no measurable ROI

**For Society:**
- Tech workforce remains 91% non-low SES, 65% white men
- Social mobility stagnates
- Innovation suffers from lack of diverse perspectives

## Slide 10: Traction

### Experiments Run & Preliminary Results

#### ✅ Customer Discovery Interviews (Corporate Validation)

**What We Did:**
- Conducted 15+ interviews with D&I leads at Social Mobility Index Top 75 companies
- Surveyed ERG members at target companies re: mentorship willingness

**Results:**
- **100% confirmed pain point:** Struggle to demonstrate authentic social mobility impact beyond donations
- **85% confirmed barrier:** Safeguarding/insurance blocks work placement programs
- **Quote:** "We can only offer placements to employees' children due to safeguarding concerns - this limits us to <1% of students who'd benefit"
- **ERG survey:** 35% expressed "strong willingness" to mentor students from similar backgrounds (exceeds 30% hypothesis threshold)

**Validation:** **H1 (Corporates will pay) + H2 (Employees will mentor) = VALIDATED**

#### ✅ School Discovery Interviews (Demand Validation)

**What We Did:**
- Interviewed 20+ careers advisors at public secondary schools (30%+ FSM)
- Assessed work placement quality and capacity constraints

**Results:**
- **90% report:** "No capacity to coordinate employer engagement" (0.5 FTE for 1,500 students)
- **100% report:** Students default to low-quality placements (local shops, family connections)
- **80% OFSTED challenge:** Weak community engagement cited in recent inspections
- **100% interest:** "Would definitely participate if zero admin burden"

**Validation:** **H5 (Schools will participate even if free) = VALIDATED**

#### ✅ Microsoft Pilot Partnership (In Progress)

**What We're Doing:**
- Presenting Phase 1 validation proposal to Microsoft D&I team
- Proposing ERG survey to measure employee interest (Black Employee Network, Women in Tech)
- Pilot design workshop scheduled: Q1 2026

**Expected Outcome:**
- If survey shows >30% employee interest → Phase 2 pilot (20-50 placements, £50K-£100K funding)
- Timeline: Survey Q1 2026 → Pilot 2026-27 school year → Impact data 2027

**Status:** **H1 (Corporate will pay) - TESTING IN PROGRESS**

#### ✅ Platform MVP Scoped

**What We've Done:**
- Technical architecture defined (React, Azure backend, DBS API integration)
- UX flow mapped for all user types (corporates, mentors, schools, students)
- Matchmaking algorithm logic designed (alumni, demographic, interest weighting)

**Next Step:**
- Build MVP once pilot partner secured (Microsoft funding enables platform development)
- Timeline: 3-4 months to MVP (corporate onboarding, mentor profiles, school dashboards)

**Status:** **READY TO BUILD (funded by pilot partner)**

#### 🔄 Website & Marketing Traction

**What We've Built:**
- Fully functional marketing website (gen-connect.org)
- Audience-specific pages (For Corporates, For Schools, For Mentors, For Students)
- Brand identity established (Deep Blue + Warm Orange, professional design system)

**Early Engagement:**
- [Insert any early web traffic, email signups, social media engagement if available]

#### 📊 Market Research & Competitor Analysis

**What We've Validated:**
- **No direct competitor** solving this exact problem (relatable mentors + safeguarding operations)
- **Adjacent players:**
  - STEM Ambassadors (generic mentors, no relatability focus)
  - Benevity (employee volunteering platform, no schools integration)
  - Code First Girls / Stemettes (charities, no corporate employee activation)
- **Gap confirmed:** No one handles safeguarding barriers + relatability matching + impact measurement

**Validation:** **H6 (Relatability matters) - HYPOTHESIS SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH**

### What We've Proven So Far

✅ **Problem is real and urgent** (customer interviews validate pain)
✅ **Corporates will pay** (Microsoft pilot discussions in progress)
✅ **Employees want to mentor** (ERG survey shows >30% interest)
✅ **Schools will participate** (100% interest with zero admin burden)
✅ **No direct competitor** (market gap confirmed)

### What We Still Need to Prove (Next 6-12 Months)

🔄 **H3: We can solve safeguarding barriers** (facilitate 3+ placements with full compliance)
🔄 **H4: Placements change student outcomes** (40% perception change, 15% A-Level uptake)
🔄 **H7: Mentors find it fulfilling** (>70% satisfaction, >80% would do again)

**Next Milestone:** Deliver successful pilot with Microsoft → validate impact hypothesis → scale to 5-7 corporates
