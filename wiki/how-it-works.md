### 1. Corporate Partnership 🤝

**Partner with STEM companies to identify diverse employee mentors**

- Target companies: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and other major STEM employers
- Identify diverse employees willing to mentor students from similar backgrounds
- Activate Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and D&I networks
- Leverage existing employee volunteering programs ("impact hours")

### 2. Digital Matchmaking 🔗

**Platform connects mentors with students based on alumni ties, background & interests**

- Automated matching algorithm considers:
  - Alumni connections (same school or local area)
  - Demographic background alignment (SES, ethnicity, gender)
  - Student interests and career aspirations
  - Mentor expertise and availability
- Creates "relatable" mentor-student pairs that maximize impact

### 3. Placement Facilitation 📋

**We handle all logistics with zero school burden**

Our platform coordinates:
- **DBS checks** - Enhanced disclosure and barring service checks for all mentors
- **Safeguarding** - Full compliance with child protection regulations
- **Insurance** - Liability coverage for all placements
- **Scheduling** - Coordinate timing between companies, schools, and students
- **Risk assessments** - Complete documentation and compliance

**Result:** Schools get quality placements without administrative overhead

### 4. Student Impact 🎯

**2-week work placement with relatable mentor + optional ongoing support**

- **Primary intervention:** 2-week work experience placement (typically Year 10)
- Students work alongside mentors from similar backgrounds
- Exposure to real STEM careers and professional environments
- **Optional ongoing mentorship:**
  - Support through GCSE choices
  - Guidance during A-Level selection
  - University application support
  - Long-term relationship building

### 5. Measurable Outcomes 📊

**Track student decisions and provide corporate ESG/D&I impact reporting**

We measure and report:
- **Student outcomes:**
  - GCSE subject choices (pre/post intervention)
  - A-Level pathway uptake (STEM vs. non-STEM)
  - University applications and acceptances
  - Perception changes ("STEM is for people like me")
  - Confidence and career clarity metrics

- **Corporate impact reporting:**
  - Number of students influenced
  - Measurable behavior change (% choosing STEM pathways)
  - ESG/CSR metrics for stakeholder reporting
  - Social Mobility Index contribution
  - Employee engagement data (mentor satisfaction, retention)

## Why This Model Works

### 1. Relatability Drives Impact
Matching students with mentors from similar backgrounds creates authentic connection that changes perceptions. Generic STEM outreach lacks this critical element.

### 2. Zero Friction for Schools
By handling all operational complexity (DBS, safeguarding, insurance, scheduling), we eliminate the barrier that prevents schools from offering quality placements.

### 3. Activates Untapped Corporate Resource
Companies have diverse employees who want to give back but lack structured pathways. We provide the infrastructure to activate this hidden asset.

### 4. Measurable ROI for Corporate Partners
Unlike generic CSR donations, we track quantifiable student outcomes that demonstrate authentic social mobility impact for ESG reporting.

### 5. Intervention at Critical Decision Point
Year 10 work experience happens when students are making career-shaping GCSE choices. Early intervention prevents doors from closing.
