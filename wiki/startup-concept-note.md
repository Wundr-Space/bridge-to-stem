# Startup Concept Note

## 1. Customer Segments

### Who are you building for?

#### PRIMARY CUSTOMER: Major STEM/Tech Companies (Corporate Sponsors)

**Key traits (demographics, behaviours, motivations):**

- **Target:** Companies on the Social Mobility Index Top 75 (publicly committed to diversity & social mobility)
- **Examples:** Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, JPMorgan, BAE Systems
- **Size:** Large employers with 1,000+ UK employees, significant graduate recruitment programs
- **Employee demographics:** Diverse workforce with measurable % of first-generation, low-income background employees (often hidden/untapped resource)

**Existing commitments:**
- Public D&I targets and social mobility pledges
- Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) for underrepresented groups
- CSR budgets allocated to education/social mobility initiatives
- Employee volunteering programs ("impact hours" measured and encouraged)

**Current pain points:**
- Struggle to demonstrate authentic social mobility impact (beyond donations)
- Work placement programs restricted by safeguarding/insurance (e.g., Microsoft only allows placements for employees' children)
- Employee volunteering is ad-hoc, uncoordinated, difficult to measure impact
- Generic schools outreach doesn't align with "relatable role model" strategy
- Hard to activate diverse employees specifically for mentorship

**Motivations:**
- Authentic D&I and social mobility impact (not just optics)
- Employee engagement and retention (purpose-driven work)
- Employer brand and graduate pipeline (recruit from diverse backgrounds)
- Measurable ESG/CSR outcomes for reporting
- Competitive advantage in Social Mobility Index rankings

**Existing alternatives / workarounds they use:**
- Generic schools outreach (STEM ambassadors, one-off talks - no relatability focus)
- Work experience programs with heavy restrictions (employee children only)
- Donations to charities like Code First Girls, Stemettes (arm's-length, no employee engagement)
- Employee volunteering platforms (Benevity, etc.) but disconnected from schools strategy
- Graduate apprenticeship schemes (addresses problem at age 18, too late for perception change)

**Customer Jobs (JTBD):**

> "When we want to improve social mobility outcomes, I want to activate our diverse employees as relatable mentors for students from similar backgrounds, so we can demonstrate authentic, measurable impact beyond just writing checks."

> "When our employees ask for meaningful volunteering opportunities, I want to connect them with students who 'went to their school' or share their background, so they feel personally connected and motivated to engage long-term."

> "When we face safeguarding/insurance barriers to work placements, I want a trusted partner to handle the operational complexity, so we can offer placements without internal risk/burden."

> "When reporting on ESG/D&I metrics, I want quantifiable social mobility outcomes (X students influenced, Y% chose STEM A-Levels), so we can show real-world impact to stakeholders."

---

#### (Second) Primary Customer: Public Secondary Schools

**Key traits (demographics, behaviors, motivations):**
- State-funded secondary schools in England/Wales with 30%+ free school meals (FSM) eligibility
- Schools rated "Requires Improvement" by OFSTED, particularly on community engagement criterion
- 900-1500 students, overstretched careers provision (0.5 FTE careers advisor or less)
- As a business, we have a "hyper-local" strategy, so we'd aim to begin in our local areas or the areas from which we have personal ties with (i.e. original home towns)
- Motivated by: improving OFSTED ratings, raising student aspirations, demonstrating social mobility impact
- Behaviour: reactive rather than proactive on alumni engagement due to resource constraints
- Budget constraints: minimal careers budget, but access to DfE/council grants for social mobility initiatives

> **NB:** These are initial parameters based on research carried out using perplexity. We'd need to validate the size of schools of this classification. We assume we'll be able to identify >10 for initial canvasing.

**Existing alternatives / workarounds they use:**
- One-off career talks arranged through personal contacts of careers advisors
- Generic STEM outreach programs (e.g., STEM Ambassadors, university visits)
- Relying on parents' careers day (limited reach to professional networks)
- Partnering with local employers (often not STEM-focused)
- No systematic alumni tracking or engagement whatsoever

**Theme:** Often these mentors are not "relatable" (i.e. not from "around the corner", don't "look and sound like me")

**Customer Jobs (JTBD):**

> "When OFSTED criticises our community engagement, I want to demonstrate meaningful (alumni?) connections, so I can improve our rating and secure school reputation"

> "When students from deprived backgrounds make GCSE/A-Level choices, I want to expose them to diverse career possibilities, so I can increase STEM pathway uptake"

> "When I have limited careers staff capacity, I want a turn-key solution for alumni engagement, so I can provide quality careers guidance without additional workload"

And beyond that "a match making platform" to help us match identify opportunities to "challenge limited pupil perceptions" and provide access to "mentors that are relatable (like me)"

---

#### Secondary Customer Segment A: Students (Ages 11-18)

**Key traits:**
- From low socioeconomic backgrounds (working-class, 60%+ FSM eligibility)
- First-generation potential university students
- Women and ethnic minorities particularly under served in STEM (potentially neuro-diverse students)
- Critical decision points: Year 9 (GCSE options), Year 10 (Work Experience), Year 12 (A-Level choices), Year 13 (university applications)
- Motivations: financial security, making families proud, proving capability, providing direction
- Behaviors: risk-averse career choices, defaulting to familiar paths, limiting self-belief

**Customer Jobs (JTBD):**

> "When choosing my GCSEs at age 14, I want to understand what careers different subjects lead to, so I can avoid closing doors I don't know exist"

> "When considering career options the only adults I know are not working in STEM, I want to be able to relate to someone with my background that has, so I can feel confident it is a viable option for me"

> "When I'm the only girl in my computing class, I want to see that other women like me have succeeded in tech, so I can feel confident this path is for me"

> "When considering university, I want to hear from someone who went to my school about what it's really like, so I can overcome my fear of being the 'odd one out'"

---

#### Secondary Customer Segment B: Alumni (STEM Professionals)

**Key traits:**
- Age 25-55, attended public schools, now working in STEM/tech
- From working-class or low SES backgrounds originally
- Successful, but remember struggling with career decisions/lack of guidance at pivotal times in their life
- Time-constrained (work/family commitments) but motivated by social impact
- Want to "give back" but don't know how, haven't been asked and would like direction
- May carry regrets about own career journey decisions

**Customer Jobs (JTBD):**

> "When I want to give back to my community, I want an easy, low-friction way to help students from backgrounds like mine, so I can make a meaningful impact without overwhelming time commitment"

> "When my old school contacts me, I want a platform that connects me back, so I can share my story with the next generation"

> "When I mentor students, I want to help them avoid the mistakes I made, so I can accelerate their path to success"

> "When I see false judgement about career, I want to help students understand what it is really like, so I can allow them to make informed choices"

## 2. Problem Statement

### What is the under served need or pain point?

#### For Corporates (Primary Customer):

**Authenticity Gap:** Companies on the Social Mobility Index make public commitments but struggle to demonstrate authentic, measurable impact beyond donations. Generic schools outreach doesn't create the relatable connections that actually change student outcomes.

**Untapped Internal Resource:** Companies have diverse employees (first-gen, low-income backgrounds) who WANT to give back and are measured on "impact," but there's no structured way to activate them as mentors for students from similar backgrounds.

**Operational Barriers to Work Placements:** Companies face safeguarding, insurance, and logistical complexity offering work experience. Example: Microsoft can only offer placements to employees' children, excluding 99.9% of students who would benefit. This creates reputational risk ("elite access") and missed social mobility opportunity.

**Disconnected Employee Volunteering:** Employee volunteering is ad-hoc, uncoordinated, and hard to measure. Schools outreach happens sporadically through individual employees, with no systematic approach or impact tracking.

**No ROI Visibility:** CSR spend on education/social mobility lacks quantifiable outcomes. Can't answer: "Did our investment actually change student career choices?"

#### For Schools (Secondary Customer):

**Alumni Engagement Gap:** Public schools lack the infrastructure to engage former students as role models, unlike private schools with dedicated alumni relations. This perpetuates inequality - working-class students don't see "people like them" succeed.

**Work Experience Quality Gap:** Schools struggle to find quality STEM work placements. Students default to local shops, hairdressers, family connections - missing exposure to professional careers entirely.

**Resource Constraints:** Careers provision is overstretched (0.5 FTE for 1,500 students). No capacity to build employer relationships, coordinate placements, or provide personalised guidance.

#### For Students (Beneficiary):

**Perception Barrier:** Students from low SES backgrounds represent only 9% of UK tech workforce. They don't pursue STEM not due to lack of interest, but because they've never met anyone "like them" in tech. Perceptions remain unchallenged: "STEM is for posh kids," "I don't belong there."

**Isolation & Attrition:** Even high-aptitude students (like Tiana, Marv's daughter) leave STEM pathways when they're the "only one" - only female, only Black student, only working-class. Lack of relatable role models creates social discomfort that drives capable students away.

**Decision-Making Without Information:** At ages 14-16, students make career-closing decisions (GCSE options, work experience) based on limited information and unchallenged assumptions, without access to people who've "walked the path."

---

### Pain Points:

#### For Corporates:
- Can't demonstrate authentic social mobility impact to stakeholders/investors
- Employee volunteering is scattered, unmeasured, disconnected from D&I goals
- Work placement programs blocked by safeguarding/insurance concerns
- Generic schools outreach doesn't activate diverse employees specifically
- No way to track: "Did our mentorship program actually change student outcomes?"
- Reputational risk: work placements only for employee children = inequality perception
- CSR budgets spent on education charities with no visibility into impact

#### For Schools:
- No staff capacity to coordinate employer engagement
- Can't find quality STEM work placements for students
- OFSTED criticism of weak community engagement
- Students lack exposure to professional careers entirely
- No alumni network or relatable role models available
- Work experience becomes "tick-box" exercise (local shop placements with no career value)

#### For Students:
- Never met anyone in STEM from similar background
- Perception: "Tech jobs are for people not like me", "Tech jobs are boring"
- Social isolation being "only one" in STEM classes
- No guidance at critical decision points (GCSE options, work experience)
- Work experience at family friend's shop ≠ exposure to STEM careers

#### For Corporate Employees:
- Want to give back but no structured pathway
- Company volunteering platforms offer generic opportunities, not personally meaningful ones
- "Impact hours" tracked but not aligned with authentic connection (e.g., can't mentor students from my old school)
- Time-constrained, need low-friction, high-impact options

## 4. Solution Breakdown

### What are you proposing to build?

#### One-liner pitch:

> "We partner with major tech companies to activate their diverse employees as relatable mentors for students from similar backgrounds, handling the operational complexity of work placements and providing measurable social mobility outcomes that prove authentic D&I impact."

#### Core features / components:

1. **Corporate Partnership Program:** We activate diverse employees at major STEM companies as mentors and handle all work placement logistics (safeguarding, DBS, insurance) while providing measurable ESG/D&I impact data.

2. **School Network Program:** Public schools get free access to corporate mentors and quality STEM work placements with zero administrative burden, addressing OFSTED community engagement needs.

3. **Student Experience Journey:** Students receive a 2-week work placement with a relatable mentor from similar background, with optional ongoing support through A-Levels and university applications.

4. **Technology Platform:** A digital onboarding and matchmaking platform connecting companies, employees/mentors, and schools (careers advisors + optional student self-service), with automated matching based on alumni connections and demographic alignment, initially focused on STEM/social mobility with planned expansion to neurodiversity programs (e.g., complementing EY's autism hiring initiatives).

#### How it works (diagram or bullet summary):

1. **Corporate Partnership** → Identify diverse employee mentors
2. **Digital Matchmaking** → Platform connects mentors with students
3. **Placement Facilitation** → We handle all logistics (DBS, safeguarding, insurance)
4. **Student Impact** → 2-week placement + optional ongoing mentorship
5. **Measurable Outcomes** → Track results & provide ESG/D&I reporting

#### Any integrations, platforms, or channels considered:

Initially we were thinking of scraping LinkedIn for school alumni discovery, but we pivoted to pilot via major STEM corporate which eliminates the need for this. We can engage and gather data from company diversity data and through Employee Network Group route.

## 5. Experiment Plan (MVP Testing Strategy)

### How will you test your riskiest assumptions next?

### TIER 1: CRITICAL - Must Validate First

#### H1: Corporates will sponsor/pay for this service

- **Risk Type:** Viability (customer willingness to pay)
- **Why Critical:** Revenue model depends on corporate funding, not school budgets
- **How to Test:**
  - Approach 3-5 companies on Social Mobility Index (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Deloitte)
  - Present pilot proposal with budget (£50K-£100K)
  - Ask: "Would you sponsor this? What budget line? Who approves?"
- **Success Metric:** At least 1 company commits to pilot funding (even partial/trial)

#### H2: Corporates can/will activate diverse employees as mentors

- **Risk Type:** Feasibility (supply-side validation)
- **Why Critical:** No employee participation = no program
- **How to Test:**
  - Partner with corporate D&I team to survey ERG members (e.g., Microsoft BEN, Women in Tech)
  - Ask: "Would you offer 2-week work placement + mentorship? What support needed?"
  - Gauge: motivation, barriers, capacity
- **Success Metric:** >30% of surveyed employees express strong willingness (even if only 10% actually do it, 30% intent = viable)

#### H3: We can solve safeguarding/insurance barriers that block corporate work placements

- **Risk Type:** Feasibility (operational complexity)
- **Why Critical:** If we can't unblock this, corporates won't need us (they'd do it themselves)
- **How to Test:**
  - Research requirements: DBS checks, insurance, risk assessments
  - Talk to compliance/legal teams at target companies
  - Map workflow: can we realistically handle this?
  - Pilot: actually facilitate 1-2 placements and see what breaks
- **Success Metric:** Successfully facilitate at least 3 work placements with full compliance (proof of concept)

#### H4: Work placements with relatable mentors change student career decisions

- **Risk Type:** Desirability + Impact validation
- **Why Critical:** Core value proposition - if no behavior change, no ROI for corporate
- **How to Test:**
  - Pilot: 10-20 students, diverse mentors, 2-week placements
  - Pre/post surveys: career interests, perceptions, confidence
  - 6-month follow-up: A-Level subject choices
  - Control: compare to students who did non-STEM work experience
- **Success Metric:** >40% report "changed perception of STEM," >15% change A-Level choices toward STEM

---

### TIER 2: HIGH PRIORITY - Validate Before Scaling

#### H5: Schools will participate (even if free)

- **Risk:** If schools won't engage even when free, program fails
- **Test:** Recruit 2-3 pilot schools, assess administrative burden and adoption
- **Metric:** >80% of contacted schools agree to pilot, staff satisfaction >7/10

#### H6: Relatability matters (diverse mentor = better outcomes)

- **Risk:** Maybe generic mentors work just as well?
- **Test:** Compare outcomes: diverse mentor (matched background) vs. generic STEM professional
- **Metric:** Matched mentors show >20% better outcomes (perception change, STEM uptake)

#### H7: Corporate employees find this fulfilling (retention/engagement benefit)

- **Risk:** If employees hate it, corporate won't continue
- **Test:** Post-placement surveys with mentors: satisfaction, would do again, impact on job satisfaction
- **Metric:** >70% say "very satisfied," >80% would do again

#### H8: Year 10 work experience is the right intervention point

- **Risk:** Maybe too late (after GCSE options) or too early
- **Test:** Track student journey - did work experience influence A-Level choices 6 months later?
- **Metric:** Measurable change in A-Level choices (can't fully validate until 18 months post-pilot)
