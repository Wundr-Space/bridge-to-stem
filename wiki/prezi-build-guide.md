#### Section 2C: Pain Points [Bottom Third - Zoom Detail]

**Visual:** Problem icons with X marks

**Corporate Pain Points:**
❌ Cannot demonstrate authentic social mobility impact beyond donations
❌ Employee volunteering is ad-hoc, uncoordinated, unmeasured
❌ Work placements blocked by safeguarding/insurance barriers
   → Example: Microsoft only allows placements for employees' children
❌ Generic schools outreach doesn't activate diverse employees
❌ No way to track: "Did our CSR investment change outcomes?"

**School Pain Points:**
❌ No capacity to coordinate employer engagement (0.5 FTE for 1,500 students)
❌ Students get low-quality work placements (local shops, hairdressers)
❌ No alumni network or relatable role models
❌ OFSTED criticism of weak community engagement

**Student Pain Points:**
❌ Never met anyone in STEM from similar background
❌ Perception: "Tech is for posh kids, not people like me"
❌ Social isolation being "only one" in class
❌ Career-closing decisions made without information at ages 14-16

**Design:**
- Use red X icons for pain points
- Dark Gray text on Light Gray cards
- Cluster by audience type

#### Section 2D: Why Urgent Now? [Side Panel]

**Text:**
🔴 **Critical Decision Point:** Students make career-shaping GCSE choices at ages 14-16

**Layout:** 5-step visual flow (left to right or circular)

#### Visual: Process Flow Diagram

```
1. Corporate      2. Digital        3. Placement      4. Student       5. Measurable
   Partnership →     Matchmaking →     Facilitation →    Impact    →     Outcomes

   [Microsoft]       [Algorithm]       [DBS/Safety]      [2-week         [Track
   [Google]          [Alumni ties]     [Insurance]       placement]      Results]
                     [Demographics]    [Zero burden]
```

**Text for Each Step:**

**1. Corporate Partnership 🤝**
- Partner with STEM companies (Microsoft, Google, Amazon)
- Identify diverse employee mentors
- Activate ERGs and D&I networks

**2. Digital Matchmaking 🔗**
- Automated algorithm matches mentors with students

**3. Placement Facilitation 📋**
We handle 100% of operational complexity:
✅ DBS checks - Enhanced disclosure for all mentors
✅ Safeguarding compliance - Full child protection regulations
✅ Insurance - Liability coverage
✅ Scheduling - Coordinate companies, schools, students
**Result:** Zero burden on schools, zero risk for corporates

```

**Design:** Deep Blue text on Light Gray background, italicized

#### Bottom Section: 3 Key Differentiators

└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
```

**1️⃣ Relatability = Impact**

## Prezi-Specific Design Tips

### Navigation Flow

1. **Start at Title (center)** - Large, impactful
2. **Zoom out to overview** - Show Problem → Solution → Impact at high level
3. **Zoom into Problem** - Deep dive on pain points (Slide 2)
4. **Zoom into Solution** - 5-step process (Slide 3)
5. **Pan to UVP** - Differentiation (Slide 4)
6. **Zoom into Business Model** - How we make money (Slide 5)
7. **Zoom out to Market** - TAM/SAM/SOM circles (Slide 6)
8. **Pan to GTM** - 3 channels side-by-side (Slide 7)
9. **Zoom out to Impact** - Big vision + flywheels (Slide 8)
10. **Zoom into Team** - Human element (Slide 9)
11. **Pan to Traction** - Validation checkmarks (Slide 10)
12. **Pan to Timeline** - Roadmap + budget (Slide 11)
13. **Zoom back to center for CTA** - Final ask (Slide 12)

### Transition Recommendations

- **Use smooth zoom transitions** - Not jarring jumps
- **Group related content** - Keep related slides physically close on canvas
- **Use rotation sparingly** - Only for emphasis (e.g., stats spinning in)
- **Path order matters** - Test flow multiple times for narrative coherence

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Largest text:** Stats and key numbers (60-72pt)
- **Medium text:** Headings and section titles (36-48pt)
- **Smallest text:** Body and details (14-18pt)
- **Use color to guide eye:** Warm Orange for highlights, Deep Blue for structure

### Interactive Elements

- **Clickable areas:** Allow audience to explore sections non-linearly (if presenting live)
- **Hidden details:** Nest additional info under main points (zoom into for Q&A)
- **Back buttons:** Create paths to return to overview slide
